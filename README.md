## Introduction

This is a capstone project case study offered by the google data analytic course on Coursera. This capstone project is to test my capability on all that Iâ€™ve learnt in the course of the data analytic program. In order to answer the key business questions in this project, its important I follow the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, And Act.

## Project Background

I am a junior data analyst in Cyclistic's marketing team, a bike-share company in Chicago with over 5,800 bikes and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic stands out by offering diverse bike options, including reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, catering to people with disabilities. While most riders choose traditional bikes, 8% use assistive options. Cyclistic users predominantly ride for leisure, but 30% use bikes for daily commuting. The marketing director emphasizes the importance of increasing annual memberships for future success. My team aims to analyze how casual riders and annual members differ in their bike usage to create a targeted marketing strategy for converting casual riders into annual members.

## About the company

The project utilizes a historical bike dataset from Cyclistic, available on the AWS file server, sourced from the City of Chicago and Cyclistic company. The data, publicly accessible and credible under Motivate International inc.'s license, offers accurate, complete, and unbiased information on Cyclistic's bike trips. With 63 datasets spanning 2020 to 2023, the project focuses on downloading zip files from December 2022 to November 2023 to ensure current information. These files are stored and extracted separately to maintain organization. While 12 CSV files represent monthly records, it's important to note that data privacy safeguards riders' personal information, preventing connections between pass purchases and credit card details.
### Stakeholders
+ The marketing director and manager, Lily Moreno, lead the development of campaigns and initiatives for the bike-share program. This includes utilizing channels such as email, social media, and others.
+ The Cyclistic marketing analytics team, comprised of data analysts, is tasked with collecting, analyzing, and reporting data to shape the marketing strategy. In my six months with the team as a junior data analyst, I've been learning about Cyclistic's mission, business goals, and how my role contributes to achieving them.
+ The meticulous Cyclistic executive team will make the final decision on whether to approve the proposed marketing program.

**Methodology**
The data analysis processing which are: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share and Act will be adopted to ensure a well-developed result.
In this project, the following are the questions to be asked and answered in other to guide the future marketing program.

1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

## Preparing the Data

The project relies on a historical Cyclistic bike dataset, accessible on the AWS file server at https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html. This data, provided by the City of Chicago and Cyclistic company, is reliable, original, and publicly available. Motivate International Inc. has made the data accessible under this license (https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement), confirming its credibility.

These publicly available sources from Cyclistic and the City of Chicago, including governmental agency data, are typically reliable. The project involves 63 datasets available on the site, stored as zip files covering years 2020 to 2023. To ensure current information, zip files will be downloaded from December 2022 to November 2023, organized into separate folders to avoid confusion between zip and extracted files. Twelve CSV files, each representing a month, have been extracted into a designated folder.

It's essential to note that data privacy considerations prevent the use of personally identifiable information of riders. Rider personal information is exclusively kept private by Cyclistic, and data users cannot link pass purchases to credit card numbers or determine if casual riders reside in the Cyclistic service area or have bought multiple single passes.
